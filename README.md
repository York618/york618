### Hi there 👋
I'm York, a student, and live in Shenzhen. A real **dude**.

Happy to learn **Python with Django** now. Maybe some **Nodejs**, **Go**. Some **Machine Learning ?** Still a long way to go.

Projects? Hmm... a little. Maybe. Publications? Hope there will be in one day. Open Source? I love it!!!!!(I'm crazy)

Am I online? Learn more on [Status](https://stats.uptimerobot.com/vxv26tWkNZ) now!
