### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm York, a student, live in Shenzhen. A real **dude**.

Happy to learn **Python with Django** now. Maybe some **Nodejs**, **Go**. Some **Machine Learning ?** Still a long way to go.

Projects? Hmm... a little. Maybe. Publications? Hope there will be in one day. Open Source? I love it!!!!!(I'm crazy)

Am I online? Learn more on [Status](https://yorkstudio.statuspage.io) now!
